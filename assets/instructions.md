# Malaria Routine Data Quality Assessment Tool: A Checklist to Assess the Quality of Malaria Program Data Instructions

A comprehensive approach to data quality assurance should include three complementary approaches using standardized methods and tools. These approaches are as follows:
* Routine and regular (i.e., monthly) reviews of data quality built into a system of checks of the malaria or other program reporting systems as part of a feedback cycle that identifies errors in near real-time so that they can be corrected as they occur.
* An annual independent assessment of a core set of tracer indicators to identify gaps and errors in reporting and the plausibility of trends in health facility data reported during the previous year.
* Periodic in-depth program-specific reviews of data quality that focus on a single disease or program area and are timed to meet the planning needs of the specific programs (e.g., before program reviews).

This tool aims to standardize and facilitate the routine review of malaria data quality at health facilities, by the district monitoring and evaluation teams that support them via routine supervision to health facilities. While the MRDQA tool provides some details on use of the tool, a User Manual expanded details exists and is meant to accompany this tool.

Important notes on the use of this spreadsheet: To use the Malaria Routine  Data Quality Assessment (MRDQA) Tool, you will need to ensure that your "macro security" is set to something less than "high." With the spreadsheet open, go to the Tools pull-down menu and select "Macro," and then select "Security." Select "medium." Close Excel and reopen the file. When you open the file the next time, you will have to select "Enable Macros" for the application to work as designed. For Excel 2016, go to the File menu, select "Options," and then select "Trust Center" on the left side bar. Then click on the box for "Trust Center Settings." Once there, select "Disable all macros with notification." Then the next time you open Excel, you will be prompted to allow macros, in which case, select "yes."

### Malaria or user-defined content of the tool
Although the checklist is for "malaria" (i.e., "cross-cutting" or "integrated"), data quality checks and elements of the checklist can be made program-specific. Each indicator, data element, and source document is capable of being user defined. That is, you can select any program area, any indicator, and any data elements and source documents for review. There are lists of indicators, data elements, and source documents embedded in the tool, and the selection of program area results in program-specific lists of indicators, etc. Please determine the scope of the data quality checks before visiting health facilities and configure the tool accordingly.

### Standardized checklists to improve data quality

The checklist assesses malaria and program data in five different ways:
### I. Evaluation of timeliness and completeness
The completeness of data elements and their data sources are assessed and quantified. In all, three levels of completeness and one aspect of timeliness are evaluated, as follows:

A. Completeness of the monthly report. Completeness of the monthly report sent by the health facility to the next level of reporting is calculated by first determining the number of cells expected to be complete and the number of cells actually complete (that is, filled in). Expected cells are calculated by counting the number of cells (data elements) in the report and subtracting those that the health facility is not bound to fill. For example, if a given service is not offered by the facility, then the facility would not be expected to report on the service and would leave the cells blank in the report. The number of completed cells divided by the number of cells expected to be complete gives the percentage of completeness for the monthly report.
